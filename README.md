## Project Overview

This project implements a modular avatar customization system in Unity 6 with runtime part swapping, animation integration, and basic rendering optimizations. The system supports both male and female character models with interchangeable parts (hair, top, bottom, shoes, accessories).

### Requirements Implementation Status

- **âœ… Modular Avatar**: Full runtime part swapping with gender-specific variants
- **âœ… Basic Animation**: Idle and walk animations with seamless part swapping
- **âœ… Basic Controls + UI**: Complete UI system with character spawning controls
- **âœ… Basic Rendering Optimization**: GPU Instancing implementation (see below)
- **âœ… Documentation**: Comprehensive XML documentation and maintainable code structure

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Core System Design
The system follows a **data-driven architecture** using ScriptableObjects for part definitions, enabling easy content addition without code changes.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each system handles a specific responsibility
- **Component Caching**: Performance optimization through cached component references
- **Extensible Enum System**: Easy addition of new part types
- **Gender-Agnostic Design**: Unified system supporting multiple character variants

### Component Architecture

```
Avatar System
â”œâ”€â”€ AvatarPartData (ScriptableObject)
â”œâ”€â”€ CharacterCustomizationManager (Core Logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ GenderSwitcher (Model Management)
â”œâ”€â”€ CharacterSpawner (Population System)
â”œâ”€â”€ CharacterSpawnController (AI Movement)
â””â”€â”€ CustomizationAnimationController (Animation On Customization)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **ScriptableObject-Based Parts**: Chose ScriptableObjects over prefabs for part data to reduce memory overhead and enable better asset management.

2. **Component Reference Caching**: Implemented caching system to avoid expensive `GetComponent()` calls during runtime part swapping.

3. **Dual Renderer Support**: System handles both `MeshRenderer` (hair, accessories) and `SkinnedMeshRenderer` (top, bottom, shoes) for maximum flexibility.

4. **Gender-Specific Arrays**: Separate part collections for male/female characters while maintaining unified management logic.

5. **State Machine Animation**: Simple timer-based state machine for demonstration purposes, easily extensible for more complex behaviors.

## Rendering Optimization

### Implemented: GPU Instancing Support

**Optimization Strategy**: GPU Instancing for identical parts across multiple characters

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `useGPUInstancing` flag to `AvatarPartData` ScriptableObject
- Materials configured with GPU Instancing shader variants
- Automatic batching for characters with identical parts

**Performance Benefits:**
- Reduces draw calls when multiple characters share same parts
- Particularly effective for hair and accessory parts
- Scalable solution for crowds of characters

### Implementation Note on Instancing Behavior

Although the `AvatarPartData` includes a `useGPUInstancing` flag designed to dynamically toggle instancing support at runtime, this flag is not yet wired into the logic. In the current version, GPU instancing was manually enabled through the Unity Editor by toggling the instancing checkbox on each material.

This also was due to a GPU issue on my development laptop (MX350), which started failing to apply instancing correctly after a recent OS reinstall. Despite materials having instancing enabled, Unity's GPU instancing and SRP batching behavior did not always apply as expected during profiling.

However, performance still benefited from optimizationsâ€”especially through efficient usage of SkinnedMeshRenderer, proper mesh/material management, and component caching. On a fully supported GPU setup, the system is expected to yield better batching results, especially in crowd scenes.

*Note: Screenshots from Unity Frame Debugger and Profiler will be added to the repository under `/Documentation/`*

## Technical Implementation

### Part Swapping System
The customization system uses a slot-based approach where each character has defined attachment points for different part types. The system:

1. **Caches Component References**: Avoids expensive `GetComponent()` calls
2. **Handles Multiple Renderer Types**: Supports both `MeshRenderer` and `SkinnedMeshRenderer`
3. **Manages Material Arrays**: Properly applies multiple materials per part
4. **Null Mesh Handling**: Gracefully handles missing parts by disabling renderers

### Animation Integration
The animation system maintains continuity during part swapping by:
- Using shared `Animator` controller across all part combinations
- Maintaining animation state during model switches

### AI Movement System
Spawned characters exhibit autonomous behavior through:
- **State Machine**: Clean idle/walking state transitions
- **Randomized Movement**: Prevents synchronized character behavior
- **Boundary Awareness**: Characters stay within defined movement areas
- **Collision Avoidance**: Smart spawn point selection prevents overlap

## Future Improvements

### With More Time, I Would Add:

1. **Advanced Rendering Optimizations**
   - Texture atlasing for reduced material switches
   - Combines multiple meshes into a single mesh to reduce draw calls
   - LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant characters

2. **Enhanced Customization Features**
   - Color/tint customization for existing parts
   - Layered clothing system (underwear, outerwear, accessories)
   - Facial feature customization (eyes, mouth, etc.)

3. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Object pooling for spawned characters
   - Async part loading for larger datasets
   - Memory optimization for mobile platforms

---

## Mobile Optimization Strategy

### Profiling Approach for Low-End Mobile Devices:

1. **Performance Targets**
   - Target 30 FPS on mid-range devices
   - Memory usage under 512MB
   - Battery consumption optimization

2. **Key Optimization Areas**
   - **Draw Call Reduction**: Aggressive batching and instancing
   - **Texture Compression**: Platform-specific texture formats
   - **Polygon Reduction**: LOD system with automatic quality scaling
   - **Shader Optimization**: Mobile-specific shaders with reduced features

3. **Adaptive Quality System**
   - Automatic quality scaling based on device performance
   - Dynamic character count adjustment
   - Animation quality reduction for distant characters

## Designer Tooling & Pipeline

### If Building as Part of a Larger System:

1. **Part Import & Registration**
   - **ScriptableObject-Based Data**: Designers can register new parts by duplicating and editing `AvatarPartData` assets.
   - **Folder & Naming Conventions**: Structured folders like `Hair/Male`, `Top/Female` allow automatic loading and organization.
   - **Import Guidelines**: Lightweight documentation for 3D artists (polycount, bone hierarchy, pivot placement, etc.)

2. **Designer-Friendly Tools**
   - **In-Editor Preview Window**: A simple Unity Editor tool that allows designers to preview parts on a dummy avatar.
   - **Customization Preset System**: Designers can save/load avatar configurations using ScriptableObjects or JSON.
   - **Drag-and-Drop Assignment**: Visual part assignment via Editor UI (optional future extension).

3. **Versioning Best Practices**
   - **Naming Standards**: Encourage consistent naming (e.g., `Top_Male_01`).
   - **Commit Messaging**: Clear messages like `add: new female shoes` help track content updates.
   - **Prefab-Based Workflow**: Store reusable avatars or templates as prefabs for easy testing and iteration.

- Efficient part swapping without frame drops

*Tested on Unity 6, Windows 11, MX 350*
